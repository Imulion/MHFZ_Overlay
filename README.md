## MHFZ_Overlay

This project is Directly Inspired from the Overlay created by https://github.com/suzaku01


## Usage

1. download the latest version from the Releases
2. install the required .net runtime 
  **BE SURE TO INSTALL x86 VERSION EVEN IF YOUR WINDOWS IS x64** 
  (this is required because MHFZ runs on 32-Bit)
3. Make sure windows did not delete the MHFZOverlay.dll file (because it reads the games memory windows might detect it as a trojan so you might have to get it out of quarantine)
5. execute the MHFZ_Overlay.exe

Top Left are Buttons for Config, Restart, Close

## Common / Known issues

- Monster Infos are sometimes outside the screen (if they don't show at all even if you open the config menu this is probably your issue)
- Sometimes you can be in drag and drop mode without having the settings open
- Road detection doesn't work all the time (use road override if road in general works for you)
- Save button is cut off in the settings menu

## TODO

- Choose which Player to load data from
- Auto Detect which Player is Playing
- Selecting Monsters for Body Parts and Monster Status
- Body Parts Infos
- Fix Max HP for Road
- Better Detection for if the Player is in Road so the Road Override is not necesarry anymore
- Discord Rich Pressence
- Add shortcut for saving
